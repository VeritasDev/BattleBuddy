"ballistics_body_1" = "The ballistics system in Escape from Tarkov is a black box that only a few people have seen the inner-workings of. Due to the complexity of the formulas used to calculate things like surface penetration chances, ricochet angles, and damage to both the armor and bodies of players, as well as the RNG-based elements they employ, there's an often imperceptible difference in the time-to-kill when comparing a fully-geared high-level player wearing the best end-game equipment to a level 1 player holding nothing more than an entry-level pistol. Coupled with the well-known networking and performance issues, bugs, and the ever-increasing number of players with epic gamer socks, the ambiguity of arguably the most important system of the game only serves to amplify the confusion and frustration both new and veteran players feel on a daily basis.";
"ballistics_body_2" = "Beginning with body armor, how does it work and what should you know? Outside of availability and price, there are five important things you should consider when choosing what armor to buy, sell, repair, equip, or throw away - class, durability, zones of protection, material, and penalties.";
"ballistics_body_2_1_title" = "1. Armor Class";
"ballistics_body_2_1" = "Every armored component, from body armor to ballistic helmet attachments, has a specified armor class. Armor class is, in my opinion, the most important aspect of protective body armor. Put simply, the armor class represents how effective the armor is at stopping projectiles with varying levels of ballistic effectiveness. Currently, armor classes range from 1 to 6, and as you may have guessed, the higher the number the better.\n\nLevel 1 armor is capable of protecting you from things like bullet ricochets, shrapnel, and non-armor penetrating rounds pistol-calibers or buckshot. Level 6 armor is capable of protecting you from most projectiles up to and even including the largest caliber rounds in the game. I chose the word \"capable\" here on purpose, because every ballistics impact involves varying degrees of random chance.\n\nWhen it comes to ballistics in Escape from Tarkov, nothing is guaranteed and the things we experience sometimes seem impossible or don’t make sense. So, what does that ultimately mean? What armor will protect me from what projectiles? That’s a complicated question that I’ll get more into that detail later when I discuss the specifics related to the ballistics impact.";
"ballistics_body_2_2_title" = "2. Durability";
"ballistics_body_2_2_1" = "When it comes to armor durability, it's important to note the specifics have changed a number of times and are, of course, subject to be changed by BSG at any time in the future. The noteworthy thing to know about armor durability is that its ability to protect the wearer depends on its current durability value compared to the original, maximum durability value when it was new.";
"ballistics_body_2_2_2" = "For example, if set of armor starts with 50 durability, it provides the best protection when it is 50/50, which is pretty obvious. The less obvious part is that any armor that is damaged and has not yet been repaired, such as armor that is 40/50, is exactly as effective at protecting you as the same armor if it was damaged and then repaired and is currently 40/40.";
"ballistics_body_2_2_3" = "Knowing the original maximum durability value for the different sets of armor, or looking at the durability bar when inspecting the item, is an important habit to get into. Often times you'll find armor with a lower class than your current set of armor, but if your current set of armor is badly damaged or has been repaired many times, you may actually be increasing your chances of the armor saving your life if you switch to a lower-class armor with a higher current durability percentage. Having a solid understand of the general protection chances for different classes of armor, durability values, and bullet penetration properties can actually be invaluable in some combat situations. Check out the Damage Calculator to start getting a feel for how it all works!";

"ballistics_body_2_3" = "There's not a ton of detail that I need to go into detail on this topic, other than you need to remember one simple rule: Armor does not protect what it visually appears to protect! The best example to demonstrate this is looking at the Gen4 Full Protection Armor vs. the Gen4 Assault Kit. The full protection version looks like it covers more of your body, but it protects your body parts exactly the same as the assault kit because it has the same zones of protection. Pay attention to what zones are protected - getting your arms or stomach blacked out can be quite annoying and is often worth some extra protection, if you can afford it!";

"ballistics_body_2_4" = "Each armor has different materials that it is made from. Currently, materials have no notable effect on the armor's protection ability, instead the armor material becomes relevant when repairing. Some materials are able to be repaired very efficiently and inexpensively, while others take significant losses to their durability when repairing and can often cost more than the original cost of the armor!";
"ballistics_body_2_5_title" = "5. Penalties";
"ballistics_body_2_5" = "Generally speaking, additional protection comes at a cost, and this cost can be financial, as well as practical. Each piece of armor comes with a set of penalties. Some slow your movement, some slow your turning speed, and even your overall ergonomics, which effects the speed at which you aim down sights, rate of stamina loss, and even how loud your character is when moving slowly or aiming. Some head protection can limit your hearing in a number of ways, and even obscure your vision. These are the trade-offs you should consider when deciding whether or not you want to go for the more expensive sets of armor or that beefy Killa helmet. Which armor and helmets are worth it? That's for you to decide!";
